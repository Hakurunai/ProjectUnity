when the player places a building
    perform a raycast from camera into the world
    if there is a hit
        if the hit is on the terrain
            allow free placement of the object
            if the placed object is a foundation object
                create a local grid aligned to the rotation and position of the object
                make the newly placed object the first member of that grid
        if the hit is on a non-foundation object
            deny placement
        if the hit is on a foundation-object
            get the grid the object is a member of
            snap position and orientation to the grid
            make the object a member of the same grid
